#This programme allows to format text in *"anGrY ModE, jUst likE ThiS"*.
It'll start by asking whether you want to write text for it to process, or use a text file you filled beforehand.
The text generated by the programme will then either show up in the console (if user input was chosen),
or in a text file, most useful for longer texts.

The programme takes quotation marks into account: if some parts of the input text are surrounded by quotation marks,
then only these chunks will be formatted, allowing for uses like this one:

*And then he told me "HaVe yOu triEd tUrniNg iT OfF AnD On aGain?". 
I was fuming, almost answered "oH, I nEvEr tHoUght oF ThAt!"*

A randomisation factor can be set on different values to get nuances in the formatting.

Have fun using it!
